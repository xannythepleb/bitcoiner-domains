# Bitcoiner Domains
Regex domain lists for the Pi Hole, AdGuard Home, and anything else accepting regex. Whitelists to allow wallet, node, and Nostr domains etc.

Will be expanded over time, hopefully to also include a blocklist for scams targeting Bitcoiners too.

# How to use

Simply add the following URL to your allow list:
